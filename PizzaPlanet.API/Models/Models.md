## Pizza Shop Model

### Here are some potential object models for a pizza store in C#:

**Pizza:** This class could represent a single pizza, with properties like size, crust type, and a list of toppings. It could also include methods for calculating the price of the pizza based on these factors.

**Topping:** This class could represent a single topping, with properties like name and price.

**Order:** This class could represent an order placed by a customer, with properties like the customer's name, address, and phone number, as well as a list of pizzas and any additional items (such as drinks or sides). It could also include methods for calculating the total price of the order.

**Store:** This class could represent the pizza store itself, with properties like the store's name and location, as well as a list of current orders and a list of menu items (including pizzas and other items). It could also include methods for managing orders, such as creating new orders, adding items to orders, and marking orders as complete.

**Customer:** This class could represent a customer, with properties like name, address, and phone number.

These are just a few examples of object models that could be useful for a pizza store in C#. Depending on the specific requirements of the application, you may want to include additional classes and objects to represent other aspects of the business.

Our PizzaDTO (Data Transfer Object) is a simple object that is used to transfer data between layers or systems in an application. In the context of a pizza store, a PizzaDTO might be used to represent the data for a single pizza, including its size, crust type, and toppings, when transferring this data from the presentation layer (e.g. a user interface) to the business logic layer (e.g. a service or repository).

Here is an example of a PizzaDTO in C#:

```csharp
public class PizzaDTO
{
public string Size { get; set; }
public string CrustType { get; set; }
public List<string> Toppings { get; set; }
}
```
This simple class has three properties: Size, CrustType, and Toppings. It could be used to transfer data about a pizza from a form on a website, for example, to a service that handles the creation of new pizzas in the system.

It's important to note that a DTO is not the same as an entity or a domain model. While a DTO might contain similar data to an entity, it is typically a much simpler object that is only used for transferring data and does not contain any business logic or behavior.
