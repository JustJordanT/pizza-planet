## User Flow

- Customers start by browsing the menu of pizzas available through the API. 
- They can filter or search for specific pizzas, and view details about each one.
- Once the customer has decided on the pizzas they want to order, they add them to their cart. 
- The cart is connected to their account, so they can save it for later or come back to it.
- Next, the customer reviews the items in their cart and can make changes if needed. Once they're satisfied, they proceed to checkout.
- During checkout, the customer make the payment, the order get confirm and they receive the confirmation

## Message Queue
In our API app, we streamline the ordering process by sending orders directly to the backend kitchen for processing. This is achieved by routing orders through an exchange, and then to a consumer exchange before being added to a queue for the kitchen to efficiently handle.

```mermaid

API App ->> Exchange: Send Order
Exchange ->> Consumer Exchange: Forward Order
Consumer Exchange ->> Kitchen: Add to Queue
Kitchen -->> Kitchen: Process Order
Kitchen -->> Consumer Exchange: Send Order Update Status
Consumer Exchange -->> API App: Receive Order Update Status
```
